# JavaScript Basics 🛫
### Introduction
This project documents my progress through the JavaScript Basics module at [ManchesterCodes](https://github.com/mcrcodes). Originally a set of blank functions, these are my solutions to the requirements set out in the accompanying Node.js Unit Tests.
This was an excellent opportunity to learn both JavaScript Functions, and Node testing, just weeks into my coding journey. The project now serves as my first JavaScript Library - containing various functions which simplify some of the more common tasks we need to carry out upon JavaScript data types: arrays, booleans, numbers, objects and strings.

## Scope of Functionalities
### Number Functions
This exercise was focused on practicing the act of writing functions in JavaScript. Purely mathematical, this section of the project contains functions for undertaking tasks ranging from simple `add(a, b)`, `divide(a, b)` and `power(a, b)` functions, to ones which required slightly more research to solve, such as `quotient(a, b)`, `roundUp(a)`, and `absolute(a)`.

### String Functions


### Boolean functions


### Array functions


### Object Functions





<!-- We can also make things happen conditionally - for example, when we reach the end of our `flightplan`:
```JavaScript
if (!nextAirportElement) {
        this.renderMessage('End of the Line!');
    } else {
        this.renderMessage(`Now departing ${aeroplane.currentAirport.name}`);
``` -->


## Examples of Use


*Consider the following:*
* **Courier Tracking** 🚚
> 

* **Train Timetables** 🚆
> 

* **Space Tracking** 🛰
> 


## Project Status
This project is complete! 🥳
